However, traditional analytical methods such as silica gel column chromatography face multiple challenges in the selective extraction of diosmetin from biological materials and traditional Chinese medicinal materials. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new type of absorbent with high efficiency, recyclability and good specificity to diosmetin. In this investigation, a magnetic surface molecularly imprinted polymer (labeled as Diosmetin/SMIPs) was synthesized employing magnetic nanoparticles as the carrier and 4-vinylpyridinyl (4-VP) as the functional monomer by surface imprinting technology. The functional monomer was screened by the binding energy (ΔE) between functional monomers and template molecules via computational simulation. The Diosmetin/SMIPs had a high level of specific recognition and adsorption capability towards diosmetin with a 20.25 mg g-1 adsorption capacity and an imprinting factor (IF) of 2.28. Additionally, it demonstrated excellent regeneration performance with 8 adsorption/desorption cycles. In addition, 91.20 %–94.16 % of spiked diosmetin was recovered from the lemon peel samples. The strategy of constructing Diosmetin/SMIPs based on computational simulation can effectively enhance the specific adsorption performance of diosmetin. Meanwhile, Diosmetin/SMIPs synthesized by imprinting polymerization showed excellent anti-interference and reusability, and realized efficient targeted extraction of diosmetin from lemon peel samples. The results of this investigation provide a promising adsorbent for selective enrichment of diosmetin from Citrus fruit and complicated materials. © 2024",Diosmetin; Lemon peel; Magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer; Selective extraction,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196807833,"Como especialista en síntesis de polímeros molecularmente impresos para fármacos, considero que el principal descubrimiento o aporte de este artículo es la creación de un absorbente molecularmente impresado (Diosmetin/SMIPs) que exhibe una alta capacidad de adsorción específica hacia diosmetin, un bioflavonoid con propiedades farmacológicas interesantes.

The modified electrode was fabricated by drop casting of the GO-AuNPs, followed by electropolymerization of 3-aminobenzoic acid to achieve SPCE/GO-AuNPs/P3ABA. The morphology and microstructural characteristics of the modified electrodes were revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for each step of modification. The composite GO-AuNPs can provide high surface area and enhance electroconductivity of the electrode. In addition, the presence of negatively charged P3ABA notably improved PQ adsorption and electron transfer rate, which stimulate redox reaction on the modified electrode, thus improving the sensitivity of PQ analysis. The SPCE/GO-AuNPs/P3ABA offered a wide linear range of PQ determination (10−9–10−4 mol/L) and low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.45 × 10−9 mol/L or 0.116 µg/L, which is far below international safety regulations. The modified electrode showed minimum interference effect with percent recovery ranging from 96.5% to 116.1% after addition of other herbicides, pesticides, metal ions, and additives. The stability of the SPCE/GO-AuNPs/P3ABA was evaluated, and the results indicated negligible changes in the detection signal over 9 weeks.

To validate the effectiveness of the MIPs synthesized for pharmaceutical applications, a comprehensive evaluation is necessary to ensure their performance, stability, and selectivity. Here's a general outline of the validation process:

1. **Binding studies**: The MIPs are exposed to the target pharmaceutical compound (template) and other potential interferents to assess the binding affinity and specificity. This is typically done using techniques like equilibrium dialysis, frontal analysis, or surface plasmon resonance.
2. **Recognition experiments**: The MIPs are tested for their ability to recognize and bind the template in the presence of other compounds. This is often done using techniques like chromatography, spectroscopy, or electrochemical methods.
3. **Binding capacity**: The MIPs are evaluated for their binding capacity, which is the amount of template that can be bound per unit mass of MIP. This is typically expressed in units of mass per unit area or volume.
