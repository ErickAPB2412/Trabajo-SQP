In this study, combining the merits of porous monolith, ionic liquids, molecularly imprinted polymer and electroenhanced solid-phase microextraction (EE-SPME), a new sample pretreatment method was developed for the selective isolation and extraction of PAs. Using vanillic acid (VA) as template molecule, mixed ionic liquids including 1-allyl-3-methylimidazoliumbis[(trifluoromethy)sulfonyl]imide and N,N,N-trimethyl-1-(4-vinylphenyl)methanaminium chloride were chosen as dual functional monomers, a molecularly imprinted monolith-based microelectrode (MBM) was in-situ fabricated. Under the EE-SPME format, the extraction behaviors and specific recognition performance of MBM towards VA and its structural analogues were investigated in detail. Results revealed that the exertion of electric field during extraction period increased the imprinted factors from 1.57–1.77 to 1.87–2.23. Under the beneficial parameters, a sensitive and reliable approach for the quantification of PAs contents in water and fruit juice samples by the combination of MBM/EE-SPME with HPLC technique was developed. The achieved limits of detection ranging from 0.012 μg/L to 0.11 μg/L and 0.042 μg/L to 0.15 μg/L for waters and juices, respectively, and the recoveries with different spiked concentrations in actual sample were 83.1–110 %. In comparison with the existing approaches, the established method presented some characteristics in the analysis of PAs, such as simplicity, high cost-effectiveness, good anti-interference performance, satisfactory sensitivity and low consumption of solvent. © 2024","Electroenhanced solid-phase microextraction; Fruit juice; Molecularly imprinted monolith; Phenolic acids; Specific recognition; Water","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196794253"

To achieve these objectives, ZnO and WO3 particles were coupled through two distinct strategies, resulting in the formation of morphologically and characteristically distinguished ZWO-I and ZWO-II photosystems. The addition of Hexamethylenetetramine (HMTA) in a particular reaction step played a crucial role in facilitating the fabrication of the desired products. ZWO-I photosystem was formed by the fusion of ZnO and WO3, yielding pseudo octahedral ZnWO4 microparticles. On the other hand, the ZWO-II photosystem was obtained by decorating WO3 nanoparticles (NPs) onto quasi-aligned ZnO nanorods (NRs). Both multifunctional photosystems exhibited remarkable efficiency in solar-driven nerve agent simulants (diethyl methylphosphonate (DEMP)) degradation and hydrogen production while maintaining excellent photostability and recyclability. Notably, the ZWO-II outperformed the ZWO-I photosystem due to the facile construction of type-II heterojunction between ZnO NRs and WO3 NPs at the interface.

This comprehensive review evaluates the effectiveness of both conventional adsorbents and smart adsorbents (SAs) in addressing organic and inorganic contaminants present in wastewater. It encompasses a wide array of recovery and regeneration techniques for spent SAs, including magnetic separation, pH and gas responsiveness, thermal and light activation, chemical desorption-facilitated regeneration, and sequential recycling of conventional SPAs, highlighting their transformation into valuable commodities such as antimicrobial agents, catalysts, fertilizers, construction materials, and secondary adsorbents. Integrating eco-friendly regeneration methods for SAs and sequentially recycling conventional SPAs into high-value products provides a sustainable solution that effectively mitigates secondary pollution proliferation. This synergistic approach regenerates SPAs and elevates them into valuable resources, thereby adopting environmental stewardship and resource efficiency. Optimizing SAs demands targeted research on their design and functionalization for greater specificity, faster response times, and improved reusability. Establishing clear life cycle assessment metrics, encompassing energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, resource use, and environmental impacts, are essential for evaluating SPA regeneration and recycling. In summary, both regeneration and sequential recycling strategies substantially benefit sustainable waste management. The choice hinges on the properties of smart and conventional SPAs, contaminants, resources, and environmental factors. We also explore integrating regeneration and reuse with renewable energy to expedite sustainable development goals. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Circular economy; Regeneration and recovery; Spent adsorbents; Sustainable wastewater treatment; Waste management","Review","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85199575514"

In this study, a series of Cr(VI)-imprinted chitosan (CS)-sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP) composites were prepared by sol–gel method using different alkali/acid combinations and drying modes. The elution of CS-STPP polymer with 1 M NaOH+5 mM HNO3 followed by freeze drying produced the optimal IIP-B+5A-fd material. The distinct structural stabilities and surface charges of imprinted CS-STPP composite determined their disparate Cr(VI) sorption abilities. The Cr(VI) sorption ratio on IIP-B+5A-fd kept higher than 97 % at pH<7, while that on non-imprinted NIP-B+5A-fd decreased from ∼ 73 % to ∼ 28 % as the solution pH rose from 4 to 7. The Cr(VI) sorption kinetics on IIP-B+5A-fd reached equilibrium after 12 h, faster than 24 h on NIP-B+5A-fd. The maximum Cr(VI) sorption capacity of IIP-B+5A-fd (41.29 mg/g) surpassed those of NIP-B+5A-fd (26.00 mg/g) and various previously reported adsorbents. IIP-B+5A-fd exhibited a much better Cr(VI) sorption efficiency (∼83 %) than NIP-B+5A-fd (∼20 %) in the presence of mixed aqueous components. The Cr(VI) sorption mechanism on IIP-B+5A-fd was electrostatic attraction–redox–inner-sphere complexation.

The MOF skeleton has a large specific surface area, thus resulting in a high loading density for the boric acid group (4.66 %) and a satisfactory adsorption capacity (482.56 mg/g). Boronate affinity strategy and the surface imprinting technique resulted in a high specificity of the target glycoprotein. Surface imprinting led to imprinting sites located on the shallow surface of nanoparticles, thus resulting in a rapid kinetic adsorption equilibrium (20 min).

Recently, great efforts have been made for research on the development of magnetic imprinted composite adsorbent, but the simultaneous promotion of stable selectivity and high adsorption amounts still faces its challenges. Inspired by “Sandwich-like” transport channels with proper steric and specific affinity sites, herein we designed a new kind of surface-imprinted magnetic colloidal nanocrystal clusters (MCNCs) with dual recognition sites (MCNCs@DR-MIPs) via sequential surface imprinted strategy. A two-step sequential surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP) was employed to construct the double imprinted sites, which can significantly improve the adsorption selectivity and adsorption amounts. In this design, the metal ion Zn(II) and the low pKa boronic acid APBA (1-allylpyridine-3-boronic acid, pKa = 7.4) could effectively tune the appropriate yolk-shell confinement sites, the obtained artificial double imprinted binding sites establishes the promising chemical environment for selective separation. As expected, the adsorption equilibrium experiments exhibited adsorption kinetics (180 min) and the maximum equilibrium binding capacity (34.60 µmol g−1). In virtue of unique advantages of magnetic separation materials, this novel absorbent exhibited a green and environmentally friendly enrichment process for naringin (NRG). Meanwhile, MCNCs@DR-MIPs showed excellent selectivity (imprinted factor 2.15) and regeneration properties (only decreased by 8.22 % after 7 cycles) for NRG. Additionally, the commercially available NRG could be effectively extracted and concentrated to 94.78 %.

However, traditional analytical methods such as silica gel column chromatography face multiple challenges in the selective extraction of diosmetin from biological materials and traditional Chinese medicinal materials. Therefore, it is urgent to develop a new type of absorbent with high efficiency, recyclability and good specificity to diosmetin. In this investigation, a magnetic surface molecularly imprinted polymer (labeled as Diosmetin/SMIPs) was synthesized employing magnetic nanoparticles as the carrier and 4-vinylpyridinyl (4-VP) as the functional monomer by surface imprinting technology. The functional monomer was screened by the binding energy (ΔE) between functional monomers and template molecules via computational simulation. The Diosmetin/SMIPs had a high level of specific recognition and adsorption capability towards diosmetin with a 20.25 mg g-1 adsorption capacity and an imprinting factor (IF) of 2.28. Additionally, it demonstrated excellent regeneration performance with 8 adsorption/desorption cycles. In addition, 91.20 %–94.16 % of spiked diosmetin was recovered from the lemon peel samples. The strategy of constructing Diosmetin/SMIPs based on computational simulation can effectively enhance the specific adsorption performance of diosmetin. Meanwhile, Diosmetin/SMIPs synthesized by imprinting polymerization showed excellent anti-interference and reusability, and realized efficient targeted extraction of diosmetin from lemon peel samples. The results of this investigation provide a promising adsorbent for selective enrichment of diosmetin from Citrus fruit and complicated materials. © 2024","Diosmetin; Lemon peel; Magnetic molecularly imprinted polymer; Selective extraction","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85196807833"

The modified electrode was fabricated by drop casting of the GO-AuNPs, followed by electropolymerization of 3-aminobenzoic acid to achieve SPCE/GO-AuNPs/P3ABA. The morphology and microstructural characteristics of the modified electrodes were revealed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for each step of modification. The composite GO-AuNPs can provide high surface area and enhance electroconductivity of the electrode. In addition, the presence of negatively charged P3ABA notably improved PQ adsorption and electron transfer rate, which stimulate redox reaction on the modified electrode, thus improving the sensitivity of PQ analysis. The SPCE/GO-AuNPs/P3ABA offered a wide linear range of PQ determination (10−9–10−4 mol/L) and low limit of detection (LOD) of 0.45 × 10−9 mol/L or 0.116 µg/L, which is far below international safety regulations. The modified electrode showed minimum interference effect with percent recovery ranging from 96.5% to 116.1% after addition of other herbicides, pesticides, metal ions, and additives. The stability of the SPCE/GO-AuNPs/P3ABA was evaluated, and the results indicated negligible changes in the detection signal over 9 weeks. Moreover, this modified electrode was successfully implemented for PQ analysis in both natural and tapped water with high accuracy. © 2023","Electrochemical sensor; Gold nanoparticle (AuNP); Graphene oxide (GO); Paraquat; Poly(3-aminobenzoic acid)(P3ABA)","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184052303"
